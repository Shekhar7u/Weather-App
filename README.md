Hello Everyone !!

Here we are going to create a functional Weather App withJavaScript.

#About App
Our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like , an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
